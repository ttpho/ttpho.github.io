### Overview


Below is a step-by-step guide to set up and run Dify with Ollama. This assumes you want to deploy both locally and integrate them to run large language models (LLMs) on your machine.

### Setup 

#### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
Docker: Installed and running (required for Dify).

Docker Compose: For managing Dify’s multi-container setup.

Hardware: A machine with at least 8GB RAM (more for larger models) and sufficient storage.

Operating System: macOS, Windows, or Linux (Ollama and Dify support all three).

####  Step 1: Install Ollama

Ollama lets you run LLMs locally with a simple setup.
Download Ollama:
Visit ollama.com/download and grab the installer for your OS.

For Linux, you can run:
bash

curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

Verify Installation:
Open a terminal and run:
bash

ollama

If installed correctly, you’ll see usage instructions.

Pull a Model:
Choose a model (e.g., Llama 3 or Mistral). For a lightweight option, try gemma:2b:
bash

ollama pull gemma:2b

This downloads the model to your machine.

Run Ollama:
Start the Ollama service:
bash

ollama serve

It will run an API server at http://localhost:11434. Keep this terminal open.

####  Step 2: Install Dify

Dify is an open-source platform for building AI applications, and we’ll deploy it using Docker.
Clone the Dify Repository:
In a new terminal, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/langgenius/dify.git
cd dify/docker
```

Configure Environment:
Copy the example environment file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

No changes are needed yet for a basic setup.

Launch Dify:
Start the containers:

```
docker compose up -d

```

Wait a few minutes for all services to initialize. Check status with:

```
docker ps

```

Access Dify:

Open your browser to http://localhost (or http://your_server_ip if on a remote machine).

Follow the on-screen prompts to create an admin account.

####  Step 3: Integrate Ollama with Dify

Now, connect Dify to your local Ollama instance.
Navigate to Model Providers:
In Dify, go to Settings > Model Providers > Ollama.

Configure Ollama Settings:
Fill in the fields:
Model Name: The model you pulled (e.g., gemma:2b).

Base URL: http://host.docker.internal:11434 (for macOS/Windows with Docker Desktop) or http://localhost:11434 (if Dify and Ollama are on the same non-Docker network). If using Docker, you might need http://ollama:11434 (see troubleshooting below).

Support for Vision: Check if your model supports it (e.g., Llava does; Gemma doesn’t).

Click Save. Dify will test the connection.

Test the Model:
Go to Prompt Eng. in your Dify app.

Select the Ollama provider and your model (e.g., gemma:2b).

Enter a test prompt (e.g., “Hello, how are you?”) and verify the response.

#### Step 4: Troubleshooting

Connection Errors:

If Dify can’t reach Ollama at localhost:11434, it’s likely a Docker networking issue. Use http://host.docker.internal:11434 (macOS/Windows) or ensure both services share a Docker network:
bash

docker network create dify-network
docker network connect dify-network <ollama_container_id>

Update docker-compose.yml in Dify to join this network.

Model Not Responding:
Ensure ollama serve is running and the model is pulled (ollama list to check).

Performance:
Larger models (e.g., Llama 3 70B) need more RAM/GPU. Stick to smaller models like gemma:2b or mistral:7b for modest hardware.

####  Step 5: Running Your Setup

Keep Services Running:
Ollama: `ollama serve` in one terminal.

Dify: docker compose up -d in the dify/docker directory.

Use Dify:
Build workflows or chatbots in Dify using your local Ollama model. Explore features like RAG or agent capabilities.

Optional: Offline Setup
If you need to run this without internet:
Pre-download Docker images for Dify (docker pull each image listed in docker-compose.yml).

Pull Ollama models beforehand (ollama pull <model>).

Deploy on an air-gapped machine with all files transferred manually.


### Note 


Setting environment variables on Mac
If Ollama is run as a macOS application, environment variables should be set using launchctl:

For each environment variable, call launchctl setenv.


```
launchctl setenv OLLAMA_HOST "0.0.0.0"
```

Restart Ollama application.

If the above steps are ineffective, you can use the following method:

The issue lies within Docker itself, and to access the Docker host.
you should connect to host.docker.internal. Therefore, replacing localhost with host.docker.internal in the service will make it work effectively.

```
http://host.docker.internal:11434

```
