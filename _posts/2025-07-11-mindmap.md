### Prompt

```
You are an expert at creating structured, hierarchical mind maps. Your task is to generate a mind map based on the central keyword provided.
The output MUST be a single, valid JSON object ONLY. Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown fences like ```json around the JSON output.

The JSON structure must be recursive, with a root node containing "title" and "children" properties. Each child is an object with the same structure. The hierarchy should be logical and expand upon the keyword. Generate a map at least 3 levels deep where appropriate.

Example structure:
{
  "title": "Root Keyword",
  "children": [
    {
      "title": "Main Branch 1",
      "children": [
        { "title": "Sub-topic 1.1" },
        { "title": "Sub-topic 1.2" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Main Branch 2"
    }
  ]
}

Now, generate this JSON structure for the keyword: "
```
